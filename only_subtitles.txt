I*m Alka*s father-in-law speaking.
Baby hasn*t returned home yet, Baby!
Why don*t you try calling her mobile?
Oh, the idea didn*t occur to me, Baby.
I*ll do that right away.
You called the entire town,
just because I was late?
Hello Jayanti. Bhadresh.
It*s not right to call
random people at odd hours.
I don*t get to talk at all,
it gets disconnected after four rings.
It doesn*t get disconnected,
people do it deliberately.
I am a gold medalist in math,
have completed PhD.

younger generation by education.
Wish you had helped at home.
Inspetor Jadeja, from crime branch.
The incident which occurred
at your home on 7th August,
I wanted to ask a few
questions regarding that.
You are exactly like.
I am like what?
It might seem strange but you
look exactly like my father-in-law.
People start resembling in their griefs.
According to the statement
of the members of the society,
there was a huge ruckus at home that day.
It*s a civil case,
why is crime branch involved?
You might be surprised in the beginning,
after the investigation
you would want to pee.
Come straight to the point.
What happened after
the fight at the resort?
We went to the resort to find
a solution between our problems.
Did you find a solution?
There was an attempt
to murder your father.
It*s recorded in the police files, that,
even the big 20 ml syringe was found.
- I have no idea.
- Liar.
You have committed one murder.
Second you have committed.
And the third you both
have got together and committed.

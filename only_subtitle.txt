wild country for the taking
some folks call it god's country well

share
what about blood
what's that supposed to mean
preacher's brother rode into town
really well i've seen his top before
a dog looking for a bone
and he's a marshal
he's a u.s marshal
you're saying that
he might not buy the fact that his
brother's death was
accidental
it could be that
accidents run in the family
they reckon that me
why don't you get yourself a coat you
know they're more reliable
my daddy give me this gun

saints according to the will of god
and we know that all things work
together for good to them that love god
to them who are the called according to
his purpose

predestinate to be conformed to the

dear james
when we last spoke you called me a
coward
i do not see the lord's way as a violent
one
but i did pray for you
i prayed that you would survive the war
and the stand for righteousness
i write you now for your help
i see how action must sometimes be taken
to right terrible wrongs
there are bad men here
terrorizing this good community
i have taken a stand and have paid a
price for it i fear for my life
i beseech you come quickly
help drive this evil away
your brother thomas
are you a sheriff
us marshall
do you know how my brother died
they found his body in the church after
it burned
there are bad men in this town and he
did stand up against them
does the word not say
that the righteous
and the meek shall inherit the earth
but tell me this
when is it time to just pray
yes the good book tells us and i quote
must not we look the other way
but it also tells us that there is a
time
a time for everything
i am but one man but i will not look
away
i see who the thieves are and i call
them mouth there
they're my brothers and my sisters there
are the servants of darkness
stand with me
my brothers and my sisters
we can rid this town of their evil
i will find out what happened to my
brother
if there was foul play someone will pay
for it
do you have a place to stay
don't camp out
we have a small bunk house out by our
stables it's not much to pride yourself
on but you're welcome to stay there i
don't want to impose man no one position
i assure you
thank you very kindly
it's settled
so
foreign
hey hey hey you clumsy old have a care
there will you
god damn
gus open that up
where are the guns they're the next
shipment
all right
close it up
you get some canvas over there
i want them getting wet
damn
hey
tom is always best with wits yeah he
thought things through
i'm more of a take action kind of man
well we all appreciated how he could
clarify the good lord's word we're a
simple folk
i wouldn't call you simple ma'am
thank you
kind sir
melissa used to teach bible lessons to
the children before thomas arrived she
recites chapter and verse in her sleep
stop it papa you're embarrassing me yeah
i saw it firsthand when i met her
sometimes all people have is their faith
and thomas was always praying
praying for something
i never understood it
you know if you if you want something
just go get it why pray about it
how do you think thomas died
we found his remains
in the embers at the church after the
fire i understand they found his burned
body but
why didn't he try to escape
they'd say he got drunk and knocked over
a lamp or something can you believe that
no
thomas wasn't a drinker in fact he
always said good night when the drinking
got heavy
you mentioned that you thought mayor
pierce might be behind some of the
trouble in town
you think he could have something to do
with my brother's death
yes
i do
tell me
men say
before the war
pierce made his money as a slave trader
when the war started many had at ease
but he stayed behind
bought himself a position of power in
town
he hired reb in his band of
ex-confederate soldiers his enforcers
and bullied his way into the mayor's
office
how would he be able to get away with
something like that
who could stop him
this is a small town marshall
anyone with any influence he hired
and the war ended
people came back and the town grew
red brought some of his mercenaries to
town and
that's when things got real bad
anyone
who stood up to reb
or the mayor
disappeared
your brother wasn't the first
well i don't bite for a minute that he
got drunk and tipped over a lamp
now something happened to him
i'm not leaving till i figure out what
this was your brother's
after the fire i found it in the embers
i remember this day
we hated standing still for so long
our mother
long time ago
her wedding ring
she didn't want to be buried with it she
wanted one of us to have it for when the
time comes
it's beautiful
journal
rather you know he kept this
no
i didn't
well
it's getting late i think i'll be
calling an evening
good night daddy good night good night
james
she okay
it's been tough
her husband was killed in antietam
shortly after she lost her son
my grandson to diphtheria
so i'd hear that
no she's getting on though a little
better every day
let's see what you have to tell me
little brother
the west
a land full of promise for many
for me
it is the land of destiny
though i left a good life full of
potential
god's calling was stronger
i am convinced that the mayor is behind
all of this our community has been
without any form of law for more than a
few years
melissa collins came by just after the
reb incident
such a lovely girl
i followed the mayor to an abandoned
mine
filled with weapons i drew a map to the
location
really gonna want to hear that you ain't
got the money today boy
like i said sir things have been slow
lately
a couple army officers asked if i could
attend to their horses next week
and maybe fix a few things next week
that ain't gonna solve the problem we
have here today now is it
gun down tell me what's going on
business
there ain't none of y'alls
making any money
we know who you are
you better learn yourself who we are
you gonna pay these men when you can
yes sir
well there you have it
that's all you'll get today get out of
here
thank you
how can i repay you
if you can take a look at my horse we've
been on the trail a long time i need
some tendon too you saved my son abraham
anything you need
it's on me
man should be paid for his work
thank you
you know your taxes have to be paid or
there will be consequences how am i
supposed to feed my family
that's enough boys
let's not do this again
let's put it down gently
and back
away this ain't over you can't just be
coming in someone else's town acting
like you own the place
well that's ironic in it
so why don't you and your
partner clear on out of here
your blessing from heaven
don't be so sure about that
hey cowboy
want to have a good time
no thank you ma'am
whiskey
give me two more
thank you
wanna go join you
thanks
i want to introduce myself
no need marshall
yeah i guess i'm not surprised
listen kevin i may need your help i
don't see how that's possible it's our
mission to keep this country safe yours
is to keep the peace
well you and i both know it's not always
that cut and dry
where were you stationed
gettysburg
20th maine
war could have been lost if you boys
hadn't held back the confederates like
you did
north and south you know you can say it
was that simple but
there's just a bunch of kids killing
each other americans
you boys at gettysburg too
second bull run
antietam fredericksburg
here's the mall
amen
so what's this about got something to do
with your brother as soon well i ain't
got nothing solid yet
but
he was fixing to bring some things to
light in this town
we'd have our eyes on the mayor for our
own reasons
however those reasons do not include
family disputes
but
seeing as how we're dealing with enemies
of the state quantro's raiders and all
might be able to do a little something
for you
do not come to me without hard evidence
i cannot jeopardize our mission just to
help you with your revenge you
understand
yes sir i do
excuse me mayor
that reverend's brother is a problem
which means what
he kept us from collecting rent from the
blacksmith
and from trumbull's store today
lord why would she fit to surround me
with a pack of imbeciles and morons
well you told us not to use our guns and
draw on folks so
what are we supposed to do
well now i'm telling you
get off my porch get out of my sight
go on
this mccord character now he can't be
allowed to interfere with my business
he's like a
disease could be contagious
gonna have to be dealt with
so what you won't do but
well
put some men on them not those two
idiots
pick two other idiots
let's see what he's up to
i'll handle it
i fed you all don't act like you didn't
get any shoe now
oh
morning i didn't see you standing there
in the morning sun your hair glows looks
kind of like a halo
well
i'm no angel that's for sure
ain't the word around town
listen i found some things in thomas's
journal might prove the mayor's up to no
good what's he finding
his map
points to a cash the journal says is
full of stolen weapons and money
i don't know how to read this i don't
recognize any of the terrain
when tom and i were kids we uh used to
play indian scout
we'd draw these maps to help settlers
get out west
they drew them in code so that if they
were stolen bad guys wouldn't know how
to use them
see
it's a symbol for north that's a pond
these are trees
point is
i can use that map to find the mayor's
supply cache
i'll go with you
no there's no telling what i'll find up
there
if something happens to me
i need you to find captain lewis
and give him that translated map
his base is just outside of town only
captain
lewis i know where this is it's an old
abandoned mine i can take you there
no i need you here
only captain lewis now
[Music]
um
so
someone shout out
oh
so
can you read yes sir
then read it to me
mayor pierce
our armory at sawtooth is heavy and we
have recruited over 400 men thus far
ready to do what is necessary in
addition we have recruited 200 soldiers
from virginia and kentucky ready to come
and fight for your territory
please confirm that you have prepared
ample accommodations sincerely mayor j.w
cooter
damn son
you read good
and you are the bearer of glad tidings
i want you to bring mayor cooter a
message from me i want you to
say to him uh you say jw
thank you for this inspiring
yeah that's what i don't knock just just
walk right in
you got something to say yeah
son step outside closed door
yeah yeah just
just have a seat
the boys saw the preacher's brother
right out of town today
where it is he was heading north
out of town as in for good
i'm sorry to say
did they follow
nope
nowhere where
i would call that
completely useless information wouldn't
you by the time they got word to me the
martial was long gone
i thought it'd be best from a sit tight
wait for his return
that's what you thought
rob
i want you to listen to me
you see
you're not educated
you're not an intelligent man in fact
you're stupid
you are a stupid man
you're a hard thug shoots people
you cannot offer me anything i cannot
buy 100 times over you understand
i hear you
therefore
i do not want to know what you think
about anything ever
i pay you
to do what i think and right now i think
you're forgetting who's running this
show
see this ain't your town son
this time belongs to me
i'm the mayor
and that's just the start
so don't you dare presume to bite the
hand that feeds you
lest you find yourself dying of
starvation
savvy
sorry
won't happen again
hey let's say that that
marshall does come back huh
i want you to have a chat with him
i want you to persuade him that it's
time for him to leave this town forever
what if he won't be persuaded well
then he's gonna have an accident
now let's not forget he is a u.s marshal
i don't want an investigation so
when i say accident reb i mean
accident
that's all
hey reb
ask that bright young fellow to step
back in here we
i'm so glad you're safe
oh well
i found it
it's all true there's enough guns in tnt
over there to start a war
do you think the captain will help us
let's hope so
[Music]
my
you don't give me a goddamn headache
one of your investors spit out what
you're trying to spit
you go
someone found the mind boss three of
ours got taken out
enough's enough
yes sir
what brings you out here recording
i followed a map my brother drew
released an abandoned mines full of
rifles
powder kegs
stolen gold
he's playing something big captain
how many rifles
50 maybe 60 crates
you know why the army sent me here
this hellhole
this area is not entirely under the
jurisdiction united states government
and there are concerns in washington
we have information that there are rogue
elements from the confederacy that's not
willing to accept mr lincoln his
emancipation proclamation well that
would explain the influx of
ex-confederates in the area precisely
these men the war isn't over we'll
investigate the mine and we'll
commandeer anything we feel is connected
to this uprising
but i cannot point blame it mayor pierce
unless you have proof of his connection
to this alleged arsenal
[Music]
hey mccoy
what do you want i got some information
about your brother
don't waste my time jenny no you know me
now do you your rebs [ __ ] what
information
not out here in the open
they might see us over here
i don't have all night
i just need a few minutes jenny
do you have information for me or not
here comes now
sorry james
i would love to shoot you in your
goddamn face right now
but the ball says to give you one more
chance to
go back to wherever you came from and
forget about this place that's not gonna
happen but i was hoping you say that
covering boys
you gonna leave this down on the horse
or in a maple box that makes them never
mind to me
pick them up
how's
that you getting the message at marshall
what's up there yank he can't hear you
spit it out
what you saying
you smell like horse [ __ ]
all right that's no
tough zone [ __ ]
let's go boys
oh
come on boy
take me
hey there marshall
you're safe now
relax you need to rest
yeah i'm sure he was breathing when we
left him
well let's hope it inspires his
departure
he'll be down to spell
give us some time to focus on business
no no
let's let the dust settle for a day or
so
give the townsfolk time to
digest and reflect on what happens to
heroes in my town
i'm going to bed
shut the door anywhere
thank
you course
i don't want you to end up like thomas
thomas and i were always very different
as a us marshall all i knew was death
thieves killers
and the war broke out
i'm laying torn apart by hatred he
preached love
all men were getting beaten and hanged
he preached forgiveness
and the world was at its cruelest he
preached compassion
that ain't me
there's no forgiveness here
thomas was a good man
i guess what i'm trying to say is i'm
not going to end up like him because i'm
not
like him
do you want to try and stand up
take a few steps
use me
take your time go slow
go slow
you all right
and who knows what david used to bring
the giant down
april
a rock
that's right
you are so smart
you're blocking my life
hey reb you are
familiar with this book democracy in
america by
alexis de tocqueville
can't say i am
oh well it's damn fascinating i mean
this man the frenchman he uh well he
traveled
all across this country after the
revolution he wrote just the most
marvelous words about america you don't
say
i don't say what
little frenchmen traveled the country
and
wrote good stuff about america now no i
did say that
never mind
i got news
there was a shootout up at your mind and
a few of my boys got cut down really
yeah
my condolences
who did it
can't say for sure
let me rephrase that do you think that
the marshal did it
i can't say
you just said that
anything missing
don't look like anything's missing you
know you are head of security for me and
i got to tell you i'm not feeling all
that damn secure these days
if the marshal is behind us it puts us
in a damned unfortunate situation with
my hands tied there is only so much that
i can do well for once you're right
yep
[Music]
this town cannot afford to have another
martyr particularly not a u.s marshal
raise your right hand
now do you
solemnly swear to uphold the rightful
duties of sheriff of our town
definitely not
just say yes i do
you [ __ ] me say yes or you're fired
fine i do
but this here is just temporary i've got
a reputation congratulations chef
i think you might want to deputize a few
of your uh
colleagues
if you do harbor
dreams of becoming the next head of
security for the first
president of the western republic
you will deal with this martial
situation pronto
will do
countless again
i've been here as marshall for a couple
years i was up in massachusetts so
i joined up with the 12th mass
marched off to fight evil
he chose head out west
priests worried
his version of fighting evil eric
but at the time i thought it was
cowardice
running away from the hard work of
putting the country back together
putting an end to slavery
oh
got a splinter
i found it
all better
yeah
what is it
when i was
reading thomas's journals i came across
some passages
about you
i thought there might be
what would you like to know
were you
close
to
you
why do you ask marshall
are you warm on me
get behind me
please give me a reason
what do you want
sorry to break up a little moment
there was a moment right
but you were under arrest
for the attempted rape of one misgender
post
what are you up to now reb well the
other night we stopped your man here
from having his way with a respected
maiden of this year community
there is no way
melissa are you suggesting that because
miss jenny used to be a prostitute
that makes it okay she never said that
and i didn't touch her
where she tells it you wrapped her up
with me you did all sorts of things to
her that even my delicate ears can't
handle
come to think on it
your brother the scum sucker that he was
he tried the same thing
runs in the family i guess
hey you're going to jail time timer
oh my my
this is a sad thing
make this ironic
you want to save a [ __ ] then you get
to take his
i'm place us marshal
you will catch out for this
already been there wasn't impressed
ready boy
not sharp enough for you
ah
please sir this is a mistake he is
innocent of these charges
is he
i can't be certain of that man
no no women are to be cherished now what
kind of a message would it send to the
the god-fearing people of this town were
out to allow crime to go on punished not
to mention the hooligans in this town
let's shudder at the thought
this is your doing
yeah well you never really know someone
do you
i suppose the accusations
could be false but of course that's for
a judge to decide in the meantime i'm
obligated to protect
the women of this town and of course
they include you miss collins
ain't that right jenny
up
you know
i've never noticed before what a
remarkably fine figure of a woman you
are
you stop this right now
this territory's about to experience a
new beginning and i'm gonna lead it
i'm an ambitious man and
well it sure would be fine to have a
smart
strong
beautiful woman at my side
your words are of the devil's tongue
well
don't you go flattering me miss colin
you know what happens to rapists in this
territory
we hang them
see if he was to be cleared of these
charges well he'd be free to just go on
doing what he has been doing and i got
to tell you that just doesn't work for
me
hey
why don't you gonna invite me in of
course baby
there you go
thank you
you know you're missing the show
why don't you come on back out with me
let me just uh
clean myself up for you
i'll get you out there baby
please i'll do anything i'll make him
leave
well i guess i could drop the charges
after all
they weren't leveled by a [ __ ]
revolting profession
messing up
cut them down
there you go
you
so
you know
you really would make a fine first lady
you know [ __ ]
it's over okay
now
we have to get james out of jail he
didn't do anything
what do you expect me to do break him
out
they're gonna kill him daddy
we're gonna meet by the old church
i'll be there
i'm gonna need your help
you got it so group of us are meeting up
by the old church
hey
now you all know my daughter melissa
and i'd like you to hear her out
good morning
there's no stage
there's no church
no minister
all that remains is tinder and ash
a good man did stand here once right
here where i stand now
his name was reverend thomas mccord
he wasn't born here
he owed us nothing
he only dreamed to see this town to see
the people in it reach their full
potential
that's why he died
but you know that
damn us
yes
i say damn us
where were we
when he stood up against the tyranny of
our oppressors where were we when he
pointed his fingers at the men who steal
our homes take food from our children's
mouths where were we
reverend mccord gave his life for us
and none of us had the backbone to stand
with him
we let him down
we let our children down
and i'm ashamed of that
mayor pierce and his former confederate
soldier colleagues intend to claim this
territory as a new republic and
overthrow our president
right now he is compiling an arsenal of
weapons and expects more men to arrive
here shortly
how do you know this we've seen the
weapons
and marshall mccord has been working
with the army to uncover their operation
marshall mccord's going to get himself
strung up he has the backing of federal
troops and he is the only man willing to
take on our mayor
he needs our help
we are strong enough
right now to do what needs to it
but when the mayor's reinforcements
arrive we will be outnumbered and if the
army intervenes
then our town will become a battlefield
i'm not going to be a slave again
i moved out west with my boy to start a
new life as free men
it ain't been easy but it's damn sure
better than it was
for marshall
he don't save my boy abraham from alaska
he come to my aid too
when reb's boyz was trying to burn my
hand
and shake me down
his brother god rest his soul
it's been there for all of us one way or
another
count me in
thank you benjamin
there's some scripture
the reverend used to quote often
proverbs 21
15. it is joy to the just to do judgment
but destruction shall come to the
workers of iniquity
justice is present
we just have to let him lose
it's time we take a stand
let's get those sons of [ __ ]
anyone willing to help me get james out
of jail step forward
howdy
what you got in the bag
well let's have a little look-see my
daughter melissa put together some
things for the marshall
you do it nice and slow like
yes
look at here
sounds like your girlfriend's done
brought us some dinner
we might even toss you a bone to suck on
look at here
apple pie
her mother makes the best apple pie
boiled eggs
oh some more bald eggs
put it all back in the sack there and
hand it over
oh she didn't
what
put this big old gun in here and you
back it up right now right now
come on back in there put that gun on
the table
give me the key
give me the damn key oh god
first of these duties
is to educate democracy to reawaken its
religious beliefs to make an awareness
to sir there's a ruckus at the jailhouse
what kind of a ruckus
and you're here i came to tell you get
back over there
yeah
reb
you get on down in that jail before they
break the marshal out won't be that easy
without these just get on down there
where are the keys
